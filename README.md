# Team API Template for Security, Privacy, and Compliance Teams

This template was inspired by and extended from the original work done by the Team Topologies group at https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Team-API-template.

## Overview

Getting started with a Team Topologies transformation, or really any intentional team design effort starts with an inventory. Defining a "Team API" for each team aims to improve each team's clarity of purpose and help other groups understand how that team fits into the broader organization. Use this template to help teams think about how they would define their Team API.

## How to use

Each team should answer the questions and fill in the details below. Remember that the answers and details will be a point-in-time snapshot of team relationships and team interactions. This can even be published, like any API, on a team's Slack channel or in a wiki. For any parts of this that are not relevant when you copy, feel free to simply delete and simplify to your team's needs.
